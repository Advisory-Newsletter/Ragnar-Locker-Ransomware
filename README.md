**Mitigations:**

To stay out of the claws of the Ragnar Locker group the usual mitigation techniques for ransomware apply.

1. Use multi-factor authentication with strong passwords, including for remote access services.

2. Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.

3. Monitor cyberthreat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login credentials and change
passwords and settings.Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.

4. Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote access/RDP logs.

5. Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least privilege in mind.
Implement network segmentation. Back-up critical data offline. Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or
on an external hard drive or storage device.

6. This information should not be accessible from the compromised network. Secure your backups and ensure data
is not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides.
